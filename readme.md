# Code Refactor Starter Code
## By Aaron Rosenblatt
#### I refactored a starter code emphasizing accesibility. Accessibility ensures people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies. I refactored the code in the file "index.html" to follow semantic HTML elements, a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. I also added alt and title attributes to the images and made the title element more consise and descriptive. In the file "style.css" I reorganized the structure and condensed several class elements that were repetitive. In both files I added comment tags so users will know which section of the website the code refers to.
